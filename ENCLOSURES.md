## ENCLOSURES

This board does not have a "full closed" enclosure, because it needs a lot of air flow while stressing it with a lot of output current. So actually the "enclosure" will consists in two pieces: a simple flat base to screw to YULC with 3 M2 screws and the fan holder, that will be connected through one of the screws

> [!WARNING]  
You can print the fan holder in PLA, but for output power >40/50W, I heavily suggest to switch to ABS due to the high temperatures of the component, otherwise the fan holder can deform bending the plastic


The base has two more holes for M2 screws that can be used to design other types of support, like a din-mounting bracket, taken from [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2613804) and modified a bit.
