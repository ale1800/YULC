## INSTALLING THE ENCLOSURE

This board does not have a "full closed" enclosure, because it needs a lot of air flow while stressing it with a lot of output current. So actually the "enclosure" will consists in two pieces: a simple flat base to screw to YULC with 3 M2 screws and the fan holder.

## STEP 1

Mount YULC on the base and lock it in place with the help of the three smallest M2 screws

## STEP 2

Use other 4 M2 screws to mount the fan on top of the holder and then connect it to YULC thorugh the dedicated JST connector.

## STEP 3

Now, with the help of the two longer screws, connect the fan holder to the two pillars of the base

## BONUS
The base has two more holes for M2 screws that can be used to design other types of support, like a din-mounting bracket, taken from [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2613804) and modified a bit.

If you want to install something like this, you have to do that before [STEP 1](#step-1)
